# ProjectPixting

    This is Pixting.  We intend this app to be used primarily for taking pictures and sending them to friends with a small caption explainin what is happening in the image.  The reciever will view the image and then have the option to reply.  The system then keeps a persistent file held in parse allowing the viewer and the reciever the ability to look at it multiple times.  Our ultimate vision is the app will work seemlessly enough that it can be used just like sending a text.
